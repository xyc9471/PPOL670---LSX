## Problem Statement 

- Whether there is a gender gap in job market in terms of income and labor force participation 
- By safeguarding the right of women to equal employment, we thus help to eliminate gender discriminiation and promote equality, 


## Background

- Growth in the Chinese economocy has generated great wealth and development in social equality, however, issues still persist:
    
    1. Employment competition
    2. Oversupplied workforce
    3. Workplace Gender discrimination


## Research Design and Approah

- Adopted survey data from the China Nutrition and Health Survey
- Indicators used to test for gender gap:

    1. Gender 
    2. Income
    3. Education
    4. Urban vs Rural
    5. Family with children or not
    6. Marriage Status

##Goals of Analysis    

- To examine whether there is a gender gap in Chinese job market using logistic regressions 
- What are the strong indicators of Chinese people’s employment status through supervised learning

## Empirical Methods and Tools

Our analysis follows this structure:

   1. Visualization of descriptive statistics
   2. Logistic Regression using a dummy indicating whether a person is working as dependent variable to explore if gender will be a significant indicator of employment status
   3. Regression trees to explore other potential significant indicators of employment status


## Visualization 1

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/Vis1.png")

```

## Visualization 2

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/Vis3.png")

```

## Visualization 3

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/violin1.png")
```



## Visualization 4

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/violin2.png")
```

##Results 1: Logit Table


```{r , echo=FALSE,out.width="75%", fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics(c("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/tables/Table 1.png"))

```

##Results 2: RANDOM ROC Comparison (Logit vs Random Forest)

```{r , echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="Logit vs Random Forest",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/logit_roc.png","/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/random_roc.png"))

```


##Results 3: VARIMP

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/terrysang/Documents/GitHub/outputs/visualizations/varimp.png")
```


## Lessons Learned

Confirms:

- That disadvantages faced by females in the labor market in China exists

Additionally:

- Education level and gender are two significant indicators of a person’s employment status in China
- As a person’s education level increases, his/her chance of getting education is higher


## Next Steps: Policy Recommendations

In the light of our findings, we recommend:

- Introducing a parental leave policy that equally applies to men
- Introducing an education policy reform that can reduce cost to women of receiving education
